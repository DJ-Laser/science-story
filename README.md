# Nuclear Adventure
A text based adventure game about nuclear bombs

Nuclear advanture is a short game inspired by old computer games that used text in the terminal to tell the story, instead of flashy visuals or graphics. It is compatible with mobile, but works best on desktop.

### Technology used
- **React:** To build the custom terminal interface
- **Typescript:** Becuase vanilla js is very silly
- **Eslint:** To fix all my silly mistakes
- **Prettier:** To make my code look acceptable and not like the absolute spaghetti that it is
- **Vite:** because weback is cringe and es modules are the future
- **Github Pages:** Because it is free hosting for static sites and vercel is silly.

### How to build
1. Install npm `nix profile nixpkgs#nodejs_22` or manually if you dont use nix :(
2. Clone the repo (I sincerely hope you would know how to do that)
3. Run `npm i` to install; stuff
4. Run `npm run dev` to start vite
5. Change stuff, it will be reloaded automatically.
6. When you push to master, github actions will automatically publish the site! (better than vercel)
